	* LICENSE-2.0.txt, Makefile, changelog.txt, gpl-3.0.txt,
	  lgpl-3.0.txt, pg.c, pgload.ado: Prepare for distribution in
	  tarball Minimal form. License appropriately, and add a maintclean
	  target for the preparation of changelogs.

2007-09-24 11:44  davee

	* pg.c: Fix for bug 774

2007-08-30 14:42  andrewc

	* Makefile, pg.c: New version: 0.1.

	  Refactor cleanup code into two separate routines. Add a `dist`
	  target to the Makefile, and automate changelog generation for the
	  tarball. Organise and tidy plugin code.

2007-07-19 16:44  davee

	* pg.c: Set SLURP to 10000, seems to be a good value

2007-07-19 16:31  davee

	* Makefile: Add an install target

2007-07-18 08:56  davee

	* pgload.hlp: Indicate which conninfo directives are
	  optional/mandatory

2007-07-17 18:13  andrewc

	* pg.c, pgload.ado: Add hooks for debugging options, and ensure
	  they get called.

2007-07-17 17:23  davee

	* pgload.ado: Add support for 'clear' and 'debug' options

2007-07-17 15:08  davee

	* pgload.hlp: Rewritten help file, assuming eventual presence of
	  options for 'clear' and 'debug'

2007-07-16 13:26  andrewc

	* pg.c: Produce textual descriptions of incompletely supported
	  types rather than OIDs.

	  Every postgres type is now at least partially supported, so let's
	  not make a false distinction.

2007-07-13 16:23  andrewc

	* pg.c: Apply DE's patch for boolean.

	  Partial support for some more types (as strings). Plugin no
	  longer crashes and burns when an unrecognised type is
	  encountered: instead, it moans about it and imports it as a
	  possibly truncated str244.

2007-07-12 12:53  andrewc

	* pg.c: Bugfix: ensure sizes of programaticaly generated CHARACTER
	  VARYING fields never cause the plugin to attempt to create Stata
	  string vars of < 1 character in length.

2007-07-12 11:39  andrewc

	* pg.c, pgload.ado: Merged changes from count_removal_20070709.

2007-07-11 12:17  davee

	* benchmark.sh, get-timings.pl, peakmem.pl: Add benchmark tools

2007-07-09 17:23  andrewc

	* pg.c, pgload.ado: Remove need for a count() before rows start
	  returning. The workspace will grow dynamically up to the limit of
	  available workspace memory in Stata. The downside of this is that
	  if there isn't enough memory available up front, the user won't
	  be told right away.

	  PGSTATA_CURSOR_SLURP_ROWS is now 100000 because control returns
	  back to the program ADO-file regularly enough for it to
	  potentially slow things down.

2007-07-06 15:58  andrewc

	* pgload.hlp: Add a basic help file

2007-07-05 13:53  andrewc

	* pg.c: Make VARCHAR(n<245) be handled the same way as CHAR(n<245).

2007-07-05 12:46  andrewc

	* pg.c, pgload.ado: Refuse to overwrite or clear data in memory.

2007-07-05 12:15  andrewc

	* pg.c, pgload.ado: Deal with varchar lengths sensibly.  Improve
	  progress messaging.  No longer call compress for PR reasons.

2007-07-04 12:31  andrewc

	* pg.c, pgload.ado: Basic progress meter to give users a clue how
	  long the load is going to take.

2007-07-04 11:45  andrewc

	* pg.c, pgload.ado: Interface change: pgload now takes a CONNINFO
	  string and a SQL query.  LIMITs now suported without dropping
	  into an infinite loop :/ Tidy up error handling in ADO wrapper.

2007-07-04 10:32  andrewc

	* pg.c: Optimisations. Tidy main fetch loop, make BPCHAROID always
	  mean something that can fit into a Stata string, replace mktime()
	  with something much faster.

2007-07-02 17:18  andrewc

	* pg.c, pgload.ado: Support formatting for dates.

2007-07-02 16:35  andrewc

	* pg.c: Support pg floating-point and numeric values.  Support pg
	  date/times and dates.  Use atol() for integer conversions rather
	  than sscanf().

2007-07-02 12:27  andrewc

	* Makefile, pg.c, pgload.ado: Initial import.

2007-07-02 12:27  andrewc

	* Makefile, pg.c, pgload.ado: Initial revision
