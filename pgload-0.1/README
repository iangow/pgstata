This is a plugin for Stata 9 integrating it with PostgreSQL databases - in
read-only mode. It is very much geared towards addressing our requirements
here at CEU, specifically for bulk imports of large datasets without
completely running out of memory.

Building and installation
-------------------------

To build it, you will first need to install

    * a C99 compiler
      - we suggest gcc 3.4 or later
    * libpq3 to libpq5 (for postgresql 7.4 to 8.x)
    * headers for libpq
      - Debian sarge: apt-get install postgresql-dev
      - Debian etch: apt-get install libpq-dev
    * headers for postgres itself
      - Debian sarge: see above, they're bundled in postgresql-dev
      - Debian etch: apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-8.1 (or 8.2)
    * headers and C cource for the Stata Plugin Interface
      - these are named stplugin.h and stplugin.c
      - we cannot distribute these files ourselves
      - they can be downloaded from http://www.stata.com/plugins/

First edit the included Makefile and adjust the settings:

    STATAPLUG_INC
    STATAPLUG_C
    INSTALL_LOCATION

and potentially

    CFLAGS
    LDOPTS

to reflect installation locations etc. Then type the usual

    user$ make
    root# make install

combination to build and install the plugin code.


Runtime help
------------

A help file is included. Once the plugin is installed, type:

    . help pgload

at your Stata prompt for a usage manual.
